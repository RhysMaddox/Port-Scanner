Port Scanner

This is a simple port scanning tool written in Python. It allows you to scan ports on a target IP address or domain name to check for open ports.

## Features

- Scans TCP and UDP ports
- Supports scanning specific ports or a range of ports
- Displays protocols associated with open ports (optional)
- Uses threading for faster scanning
- Provides a progress bar during scanning

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/RhysMaddox/port-scanner.git
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Run the script.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the target IP address/domain name and select the ports to scan.
5. Optionally, choose whether to display protocols for open ports.
6. Once the scanning is complete, the script will display the open ports (and associated protocols, if selected) or a message indicating no open ports were found.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tqdm library (for the progress bar)

You can install the tqdm library using pip:
